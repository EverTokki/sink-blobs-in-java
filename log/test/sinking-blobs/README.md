# Sinking Blobs

From the UBC CPSC 110 Helpers Lab: 
```
Consider a test tube filled with solid blobs and bubbles.
Over time, the solids sink to the bottom of the test tube
and as a consequence, the bubbles percolate to the top.

For this problem, you will complete the design of a world program that displays the test tube of blobs.
Initially, the test tube is empty, but we can add solid blobs and bubbles by 
pressing the "s" and "b" keys respectively. 

Pressing the spacebar will sink each solid blob by one.
```

# Sink blobs... but in Java

The problem above is intended for an implementation in Racket, a functional programming language. Its main focus is to use recursion in order to make the bubbles sink. How would this be implemented in Java?

Many of the code used in this project is an implementation of source code received from the CPSC 210 class, specifically the SpaceInvaders Lab work.
